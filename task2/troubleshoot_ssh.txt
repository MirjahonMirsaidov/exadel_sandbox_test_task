1. Open terminal on your local machine and write 'ssh' to check if openssh-client is installed.
2. Install openssh-client then you can SSH into any machine with the server-side application on it
3. Open terminal on your server machine and write 'ssh localhost', if openssh server is not installed
you'll reseive response like 'ssh: connect to host localhost port 22: Connection refused username@host:~$'
4. Install ssh server via 'sudo apt-get install openssh-server ii'
5. Check if ssh server is running via 'sudo service ssh status'
6. Open the SSH terminal on your machine and run 'ssh your_username@host_ip_address '
7. Make sure that you know the correct TCP port OpenSSH is listening to for connection requests
 and that the port forwarding settings are correct. The default port is 22 if nobody changed configuration
 in the sshd_config file. You may also just append the port number after the host IP address.
Now you should be able to connect via ssh without any problem
